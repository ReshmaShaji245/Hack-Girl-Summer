## Inspiration 
There is no limit to what we, as women can accomplish. So it is the duty of every woman to support each other, empower each other, and help each other rise. At this time of the crisis, we believe that our small endeavour could support other women and help everyone stay safe and happy at their homes, while help them buy things they need.

## Function 
She Boss is a website, through which we can find women owned enterprises easily, connect new emerging enterprises with the buyers, by registering in our site, and help them find new products. So, any woman willing to start their business career could register at our site, sell their products, staying safe and happy at home. And any person could purchase products what they desire,staying safe and happy at home as well. We believe in the happiness, satisfaction and comfort of people.

## Languages and tools used
Our website She Boss, is built on the Flask framework and hosted on Heroku servers.The entire code has been developed using Python programming language. The frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. We also used SQL(postgresql) for our database to store user info, business info and to keep track of reviews. App was deployed using Heroku.
